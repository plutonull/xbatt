1. WHAT IS XBATT? 

  xbatt is an X11 client which displays the battery status of your
notebook computer equiped with APM (Advanced Power Management) BIOS.
It works for both FreeBSD and Linux.  The status displayed consists of
the remaining battery life, the AC line status, and the charging
status.

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENT

  xbatt acquires the battery status via the ACPI driver.
  The ACPI driver should be already configured on your Linux system, if it is not, you will have to load the correct driver module, consult your distribution's documentation for more information.

3. INSTALLATION

  To build xbatt, you will need the XPM library (libXpm), which is
included in X11R6 contrib.  If you use FreeBSD, and you don't want
make xbatt from the source, install package named `xpm-3.4*.tgz'.

  To make the program, type:
	xmkmf
	make
  To install the program, type:
	make install


4. FEATURES

  xbatt checks a battery status once in every 30 seconds, and updates
its display if necessary.  If you move your mouse cursor to the
battery icon, xbatt will get current battery information, and display
in 1% units (if your BIOS supports this).

  To change the update interval, specify the -titerInterval option, or
change the macro UPDATE_INTERVAL which written in Imakefile.

  If xbatt doesn't display the correct status after resume, then move
the mouse cursor to battery icon.  This action will reset the xbatt
timer.

  If you use fvwm, you can 'stick' xbatt to the screen's glass by
adding the following line to ~/.fvwmrc:

	Style "xbatt" NoTitle,Sticky,StaysOnTop,WindowListSkip,CirculateSkip

  If you use FvwmButtons, you can put xbatt to your button area by
adding the following line to ~/.fvwmrc:

	*FvwmButtons(Title xbatt, Swallow(UseOld) "xbatt" \
		'Exec /usr/local/bin/xbatt &')
